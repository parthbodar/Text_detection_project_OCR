# Real-Time Text Detection using OCR and OpenCV

This project demonstrates a **real-time text detection** system using Python, OpenCV, and Tesseract OCR. It processes live webcam feed or screen captures to detect and recognize text in images.

## **Features**
- Real-time text detection from webcam feed.
- Option to capture and process screen regions.
- Displays bounding boxes and recognized characters on the frame.
- Measures and displays FPS (Frames Per Second) for performance.
